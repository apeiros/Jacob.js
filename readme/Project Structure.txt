PROJECT STRUCTURE

The directories are structured as following, the audience is noted in brackets,
e.g. [developers] means you're interest in this directory if you intend to
work on jacob itself, while [consumers] is of interest to users of jacob:

* dependencies.yaml [developers]
  This file is used by some rake tasks (http://rake.rubyforge.org/, also see
  `Rakefile` below).
* examples: [consumers]
  Contains a series of examples for the jacob libraries.
* external: [developers]
  Javascripts that are not part of jacob, but upon which Jacob depends
* javascripts: [consumers]
  The compiled minified (.js) and unminified (-dev.js) javascripts
* lib: [developers]
  All "classes" in a separate file. This is useful for developing. Dependencies
  are not compiled.
* locales: [consumers]
  A couple of locale files for jacob-i18n.js (and jacob.js) with useful
  translations and translators.
* Rakefile: [developers]
  This file defines the rake tasks. Install ruby (http://ruby-lang.org) and rake
  (http://rake.rubyforge.org/) to run the tasks.
* readme: [consumers, developers]
  This directory contains a couple of readmes, some relevant for consumers,
  some for developers.
* README.txt: [consumers, developers]
  The global readme file. You should read it. Or at least a part of it.
